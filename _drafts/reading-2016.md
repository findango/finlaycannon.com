[Get Jiro!](https://www.amazon.com/Get-Jiro-Anthony-Bourdain/dp/1401228283/), by Anthony Bourdain (3/5)  
Fun and trivial, a dystopian future where chefs rule the world. Lots of familiar themes from Bourdain.

[Oishinbo, Volume 1 - Japanese Cuisine](https://www.amazon.com/OISHINBO-JAPANESE-CUISINE-Tetsu-Kariya/dp/1421521393/), by Tetsu Kariya (3/5)  
Now I know how to eat nori.

[Oishinbo, Volume 3 - Ramen and Gyoza](https://www.amazon.com/Oishinbo-Carte-Vol-Ramen-Gyoza/dp/1421521415/), by Tetsu Kariya (3/5)  
Weaker than the previous ones. And some of the translations felt like they were done by a high-schooler.

[UI is Communication](https://www.amazon.com/UI-Communication-Intuitive-Interfaces-Effective/dp/0123969808/), by Everett N. McKay (5/5)  
Just framing the UI, and the design process, as a conversation suddenly makes so many things obvious and easier. I couldn't articulate before why certain UIs really frustrated me, but they were conversations with annoying, pedantic, forgetful people.

[Oishinbo, Volume 4 - Fish, Sushi and Sashimi](https://www.amazon.com/Oishinbo-Carte-Vol-Sushi-Sashimi/dp/1421521423/), by Tetsu Kariya (3/5)  
Better than the ramen edition, I think. Have to see which of these fish are available locally.

[你最喜欢谁？Whom Do You Like More?](https://www.amazon.com/Chinese-Breeze-300-word-Graded-Reader/dp/7301141556/), by Yuehua Liu (4/5)  
Very basic story, but not too repetitive. Includes recorded readings (normal and slow speed) which really help practicing to read.

[Oishinbo, Volume 2 - Sake](https://www.amazon.com/Oishinbo-%C3%A0-Carte-Vol-Sake/dp/1421521407/)，by Tetsu Kariya (3/5)  
A bit more detailed information than some of the other volumes? Still, these have such a repetitive format, it's hard to stay interested.

[In Praise of Shadows](https://www.amazon.com/Praise-Shadows-Junichiro-Tanizaki/dp/0918172020/), by Jun'ichirō Tanizaki (4/5)  
"Westerners are amazed at the simplicity of Japanese rooms, perceiving them no more than ashen walls bereft of ornament. Their reaction is understandable, but it betrays a failure to comprehend the mystery of shadows."

[The MetaHack Interviews](https://www.amazon.com/MetaHack-Interviews-Ted-Chiang-ebook/dp/B00AGU3HMC/), by Avi Solomon (4/5)  
Came for the interview with Ted Chiang, stayed for the other interesting bits that sent me off searching for more information.

[So Me](https://www.amazon.com/So-Me-Graham-Norton/dp/0340833491/), by Graham Norton (4/5)  
My favourite talk show. Can only read it in his voice.

[Fluent Forever](https://www.amazon.com/Fluent-Forever-Learn-Language-Forget/dp/0385348118/), by Gabriel Wyner (4/5)  
Some really good tips, especially the focus on learning the sound-system, which is almost never taught effectively. Mostly focuses on how to create and use flashcards. Read Paul Nation's "What do you need to know to learn a foreign language" for a broader overview (e.g., tasks for input vs developing fluency).

[连个想上天的孩子 Two Children Seeking the Joy Bridge](https://www.amazon.com/Children-Seeking-Bridge-Chinese-Breeze/dp/7301079214/), by Yuehua Liu (4/5)  
Another good graded reader, great for increasing reading fluency. My minor irritation with this series is that the footnote numbers for new vocabulary often split a two-character word or compound, making it harder (as a beginner) to recognize them as a single unit.

[Ex-Formation](https://www.amazon.com/Ex-formation-Kenya-Hara/dp/3037784660/), by Kenya Hara (3/5)  
My favourites were the solid smoke shapes, and the bottles-as-bodies.

[Teamwork Is an Individual Skill](https://www.amazon.com/Teamwork-Individual-Skill-Getting-Responsibility/dp/1576751554/), by Christopher Avery (4/5)

[A Fire Upon the Deep](https://www.amazon.com/Fire-Upon-Deep-Zones-Thought/dp/0812515285/), by Vernor Vinge (3/5)  
Sci-fi meets fantasy? I liked the whole premise of the zones, and some of the hard sci-fi, but the softer bits were pretty weak and not really compelling. Probably won't read #2.

[Tetris: The Games People Play](https://www.amazon.com/Tetris-Games-People-Box-Brown/dp/162672315X/), by Box Brown (3/5)  
Fun, quick history of a perfect game. Read 'The Making of Prince of Persia' if you're interested in a developer view of this era of programming.

[Zone to Win](https://www.amazon.com/Zone-Win-Organizing-Compete-Disruption/dp/1682302113/), by Geoffrey A. Moore (4/5)  
It's a good articulation of a rational strategy that seems to fit the problem. Changing to adopt such a strategy is probably as hard as the original problem. I recommend 'Good Strategy, Bad Strategy' as a good compliment.

[The Lady and the Monk: Four Seasons in Kyoto](https://www.amazon.com/Lady-Monk-Four-Seasons-Kyoto/dp/0679738347/), by Pico Iyer (5/5)  
A beautiful exploration of cross-cultural understanding and misunderstanding. Read while in Kyoto.
