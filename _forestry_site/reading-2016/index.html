          <h2>Reading 2016</h2>
    <p class="date">03 Sep 2018</p>

    <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Get-Jiro-Anthony-Bourdain/dp/1401228283/">Get Jiro!</a>, by Anthony Bourdain (3/5)<br>
Fun and trivial, a dystopian future where chefs rule the world. Lots of familiar themes from Bourdain.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/OISHINBO-JAPANESE-CUISINE-Tetsu-Kariya/dp/1421521393/">Oishinbo, Volume 1 - Japanese Cuisine</a>, by Tetsu Kariya (3/5)<br>
Now I know how to eat nori.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Oishinbo-Carte-Vol-Ramen-Gyoza/dp/1421521415/">Oishinbo, Volume 3 - Ramen and Gyoza</a>, by Tetsu Kariya (3/5)<br>
Weaker than the previous ones. And some of the translations felt like they were done by a high-schooler.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/UI-Communication-Intuitive-Interfaces-Effective/dp/0123969808/">UI is Communication</a>, by Everett N. McKay (5/5)<br>
Just framing the UI, and the design process, as a conversation suddenly makes so many things obvious and easier. I couldn&#39;t articulate before why certain UIs really frustrated me, but they were conversations with annoying, pedantic, forgetful people.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Oishinbo-Carte-Vol-Sushi-Sashimi/dp/1421521423/">Oishinbo, Volume 4 - Fish, Sushi and Sashimi</a>, by Tetsu Kariya (3/5)<br>
Better than the ramen edition, I think. Have to see which of these fish are available locally.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Chinese-Breeze-300-word-Graded-Reader/dp/7301141556/">你最喜欢谁? Whom Do You Like More?</a>, by Yuehua Liu (4/5)<br>
Very basic story, but not too repetitive. Includes recorded readings (normal and slow speed) which really help practicing to read.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Oishinbo-%C3%A0-Carte-Vol-Sake/dp/1421521407/">Oishinbo, Volume 2 - Sake</a>，by Tetsu Kariya (3/5)<br>
A bit more detailed information than some of the other volumes? Still, these have such a repetitive format, it&#39;s hard to stay interested.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Praise-Shadows-Junichiro-Tanizaki/dp/0918172020/">In Praise of Shadows</a>, by Jun&#39;ichirō Tanizaki (4/5)<br>
&quot;Westerners are amazed at the simplicity of Japanese rooms, perceiving them no more than ashen walls bereft of ornament. Their reaction is understandable, but it betrays a failure to comprehend the mystery of shadows.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/MetaHack-Interviews-Ted-Chiang-ebook/dp/B00AGU3HMC/">The MetaHack Interviews</a>, by Avi Solomon (4/5)<br>
Came for the interview with Ted Chiang, stayed for the other interesting bits that sent me off searching for more information.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/So-Me-Graham-Norton/dp/0340833491/">So Me</a>, by Graham Norton (4/5)<br>
My favourite talk show. Can only read it in his voice.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fluent-Forever-Learn-Language-Forget/dp/0385348118/">Fluent Forever</a>, by Gabriel Wyner (4/5)<br>
Some really good tips, especially the focus on learning the sound-system, which is almost never taught effectively. Mostly focuses on how to create and use flashcards. Read Paul Nation&#39;s &quot;What do you need to know to learn a foreign language&quot; for a broader overview (e.g., tasks for input vs developing fluency).</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Children-Seeking-Bridge-Chinese-Breeze/dp/7301079214/">连个想上天的孩子 Two Children Seeking the Joy Bridge</a>, by Yuehua Liu (4/5)<br>
Another good graded reader, great for increasing reading fluency. My minor irritation with this series is that the footnote numbers for new vocabulary often split a two-character word or compound, making it harder (as a beginner) to recognize them as a single unit.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ex-formation-Kenya-Hara/dp/3037784660/">Ex-Formation</a>, by Kenya Hara (3/5)<br>
My favourites were the solid smoke shapes, and the bottles-as-bodies.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Teamwork-Individual-Skill-Getting-Responsibility/dp/1576751554/">Teamwork Is an Individual Skill</a>, by Christopher Avery (4/5)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-Upon-Deep-Zones-Thought/dp/0812515285/">A Fire Upon the Deep</a>, by Vernor Vinge (3/5)<br>
Sci-fi meets fantasy? I liked the whole premise of the zones, and some of the hard sci-fi, but the softer bits were pretty weak and not really compelling. Probably won&#39;t read #2.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tetris-Games-People-Box-Brown/dp/162672315X/">Tetris: The Games People Play</a>, by Box Brown (3/5)<br>
Fun, quick history of a perfect game. Read &#39;The Making of Prince of Persia&#39; if you&#39;re interested in a developer view of this era of programming.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Zone-Win-Organizing-Compete-Disruption/dp/1682302113/">Zone to Win</a>, by Geoffrey A. Moore (4/5)<br>
It&#39;s a good articulation of a rational strategy that seems to fit the problem. Changing to adopt such a strategy is probably as hard as the original problem. I recommend &#39;Good Strategy, Bad Strategy&#39; as a good compliment.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lady-Monk-Four-Seasons-Kyoto/dp/0679738347/">The Lady and the Monk: Four Seasons in Kyoto</a>, by Pico Iyer (5/5)<br>
A beautiful exploration of cross-cultural understanding and misunderstanding. Read while in Kyoto.</p>
