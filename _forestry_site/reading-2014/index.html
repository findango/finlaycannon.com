          <h2>Reading 2014</h2>
    <p class="date">28 Dec 2014</p>

    <p><a href="http://amazon.com/dp/039332043X/">The Gift: The Form and Reason for Exchange in Archaic Societies</a>, <em>by Marcel Mauss (5/5)</em>.
Very interesting essay on the history and function of &quot;gift giving&quot; (gift
almost certainly carries the wrong connotation). Covers the potlatch culture
of West Coast natives, Brahmin society in India, and the origins of Roman and
German law. Fascinating to see how these traditions are retained in
contemporary society, either through explicit laws or implicit cultural
expectations.</p>

<p><a href="http://amazon.com/dp/0930289234/">Watchmen</a>, <em>by Alan Moore (3/5)</em>.
A few of my friends consider this to be an amazing work, but I think I just
read it at the wrong time. I remember that feeling of Cold War impending doom
(although I was relatively young), but it&#39;s just too far away to give this
real impact. I do like Alan Moore&#39;s point about Rorschach being an
exploration of what Batman would be in real life (psychopathic).</p>

<p><a href="http://amazon.com/dp/0141311401/">Boy: Tales of Childhood</a>, <em>by Roald Dahl (3/5)</em>.</p>

<p><a href="http://amazon.com/dp/006197014X/">Diagraphics</a>, <em>by Macarena San Martin (3/5)</em>.
Some nice examples of infographics (not analytic visualizations). Lots of
stuff that didn&#39;t appeal to me visually, but there are a few gems in there to
inspire.</p>

<p><a href="http://amazon.com/dp/0878301178/">Impro</a>, <em>by Keith Johnstone (5/5)</em>.
This has been on my list to read for ages... why did I wait so long? It&#39;s
nominally about improvisation for theatre actors, but really it&#39;s as much
about the theatre of life. People play funny games, and behave in ways
mysterious even to themselves.</p>

<p><a href="http://amazon.com/dp//">Replay</a>, <em>by Ken Grimwood (3/5)</em>.
Meh. A fairly predictable run of events, mostly about getting a do-over on
things you regret in life, with an un-surprising conclusion. I breezed through
it on a plane ride.</p>

<p><a href="http://amazon.com/dp/1933330236/">A Tractate on Japanese Aesthetics</a>, <em>by Donald Richie (3/5)</em>.
Turns out seventeenth-century tea masters were the original hipsters,
elevating the old and ordinary to a refined aesthetic (complicated
simplicity). Of course Japan has compartmentalized and codified aesthetics to
an extreme (unique?) level -- this essay also reminds us that these concepts
have complex histories, in which they were redefined and repurposed to suit
elite political and class distinctions. It was an interesting but not
inspiring read.</p>

<p><a href="http://amazon.com/dp/111846219X/">Data Points: Visualization That Means Something</a>, <em>by Nathan Yau (3/5)</em>.
A good, solid, overview of creating meaningful visualizations. There is much
more detail in books like &quot;Grammar of Graphics&quot;, &quot;Semiology of Graphics&quot;, or
any of Tufte&#39;s work, but this one pulls the basics together in one place, with
good looking examples.</p>

<p><a href="http://amazon.com/dp/1881052338/">Patterns of High Performance: Discovering the Ways People Work Best</a>, <em>by Jerry L. Fletcher (4/5)</em>.
This book has some interesting reminders about recognizing and working within
your personal best patterns, and the individuality of those patterns. The
format is mostly anecdotal, with case studies from the author&#39;s consulting
practice, so a lot of it is really general coaching observations, and there&#39;s
very little methodology. Still, it made me reflect on my own situations, and
could definitely be a useful trigger.</p>

<p><a href="http://amazon.com/dp/1853261890/">The Best Short Stories</a>, <em>by Guy de Maupassant (4/5)</em>.
Elaborate and unresolved. His style kind of grew on me.</p>

<p><a href="http://amazon.com/dp/0393244660/">Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt</a>, <em>by Michael Lewis (4/5)</em>.
Frightening... but not terribly surprising. Take a bunch of people with a
history of bad behaviour, give them a financial incentive and don&#39;t watch them
closely, and they will behave badly (ie, make off like bandits). Engaging
writing, but it could have been shorter.</p>

<p><a href="http://amazon.com/dp/0446678791/">Free Agent Nation: The Future of Working for Yourself</a>, <em>by Daniel H. Pink (3/5)</em>.
Lots of values in here that resonate with me. The book is quite dry, and seems
a little dated (2001) -- it would be interesting to see newer numbers to see
how these trends progressed, especially in light of services like AWS and
Stripe that make it easier than ever to independently serve your stuff to the
world. Feels like a bit of a companion to The Cluetrain Manifesto.</p>

<p><a href="http://amazon.com/dp//">The Emperor&#39;s River: Travels to the Heart of a Resurgent China</a>, <em>by Liam James D&#39;Arcy-Brown (3/5)</em>.
Interesting topic, but not a very engaging read.</p>

<p><a href="http://amazon.com/dp/1583941150/">Body and Mature Behavior: A Study of Anxiety, Sex, Gravitation, and Learning</a>, <em>by Moshé Feldenkrais (4/5)</em>.
A holistic view of body and mind, layering of the nervous system, and patterns
of development. I don&#39;t know if his theories are strictly correct, but they&#39;re
quite interesting and thought-provoking.</p>

<p><a href="http://amazon.com/dp/0974551627/">Marching Bands Are Just Homeless Orchestras</a>, <em>by Tim Siedell (3/5)</em>.
Tweets in a book. Some hilarious one-liners in here. Very short. </p>

<p><a href="http://amazon.com/dp/0393310728/">How to Lie with Statistics</a>, <em>by Darrell Huff (4/5)</em>.<br>
A classic. I think people are a little more aware of &quot;correlation-causation&quot;,
etc, these days, but the warnings about unqualified averages, percentages,
general charting trickery are timeless.</p>

<p><a href="http://amazon.com/dp/0916636003/">Language Acquisition Made Practical</a>, <em>by E. Thomas Brewster (5/5)</em>.<br>
A very detailed framework for building your own language study plan. It was
originally written for people learning a language where there was no pre-
existing material (eg, making recordings, etc), while these days you probably
already have access to lots of high-quality audio. But it&#39;s still important to
understand a structure and set of techniques -- your Pimsleur or Assimil
course will get you started, but you really have to take ownership of the
process if you want to reach a higher level.</p>

<p><a href="http://amazon.com/dp/1607740087/">Artisan Cheese Making at Home</a>, <em>by Mary Karlin (5/5)</em>.
Gorgeous pictures, home-sized recipes, and lots of information on tools, cultures, etc. </p>

<p><a href="http://amazon.com/dp/1449335586/">Scope and Closures (You Don&#39;t Know JS)</a>, <em>by Kyle Simpson (5/5)</em>.
Brief and extremely clear explanation. Some good points (eg, details of
function hoisting) that I hadn&#39;t tripped over before, but am glad to know now. </p>

<p><a href="http://amazon.com/dp/B00MT612SC/">Observations of a Straight White Male with No Interesting Fetishes</a>, <em>by Peter Hunt Welch (4/5)</em>.
Amusing and quick. Sort of reminds me of Chuck Klosterman. </p>

<p><a href="http://amazon.com/dp/1451665067/">Happy Money: The Science of Smarter Spending</a>, <em>by Elizabeth Dunn (3/5)</em>.
Some interesting points, but it felt like it could be half the length. Just
full of &quot;Studies show...&quot; and &quot;Researchers asked students...&quot; </p>

<p><a href="http://amazon.com/dp/1491904151/">This &amp; Object Prototypes (You Don&#39;t Know JS)</a>, <em>by Kyle Simpson (4/5)</em>.
Another solid review of the internals of JS. All devs should probably read this,
if only to drive the idea out of their heads that OO and inheritance are somehow
intrinsic to software.</p>

<p><a href="http://amazon.com/dp/0804139296/">Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future</a>, <em>by Peter Thiel (4/5)</em>.
A clarion call to Definite Optimism... build the Better Future, starting now. </p>

<p><a href="http://amazon.com/dp/0307739791/">十個詞彙裡的中國 (China in Ten Words)</a>, <em>by Yu Hua (4/5)</em>. The tragedy of the
Cultural Revolution, followed by the rebound into economic explosion (but with
incredible disparity inside the country). A very interesting perspective on
contemporary Chinese culture.</p>

<p><a href="http://amazon.com/dp/B003Y3BB9O/">Dreaming in Chinese</a>, <em>by Deborah Fallows (3/5)</em>.
A fun and very light (after reading &#39;China in Ten Words&#39;) take on aspects of
Chinese culture, via the use, structure, and idioms of the language. </p>

<p><a href="http://amazon.com/dp/0307387569/">The Man Within My Head</a>, <em>by Pico Iyer (3/5)</em>. 
I&#39;m a big fan of Graham Greene, and this gave me lots of new perspectives on
him, and will make me go back to reread some books. Overall, this one started
strong and interesting, but went adrift in the middle (uncertain structure),
then finished reasonably well.</p>
