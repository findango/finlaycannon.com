          <h2>Reading 2015</h2>
    <p class="date">06 Feb 2016</p>

    <p><a href="http://amazon.com/dp/0446531502/">The Art of Profitability</a>, <em>by Adrian J. Slywotzky (3/5)</em>.
Semi-interesting catalog of 23 profit models. But I always find the
&quot;instructive conversation&quot; style in books really contrived and painful. Pair
with &quot;Staying Power&quot;, by Michael Cusumano for another interesting perspective.</p>

<p><a href="http://amazon.com/dp/0679642609/">Meditations: A New Translation</a>, <em>by Marcus Aurelius (4/5)</em>.
Re-read 2015. Such a great mixture of notes-to-self, and zen-like observations
of the world. Check out &quot;Only Don&#39;t Know&quot;, (teaching letters to students) by
Seung Sahn for a very complimentary Zen perspective.</p>

<p><a href="http://amazon.com/dp/1430308001/">Predator at the Chessboard</a>, <em>by Ward Farnsworth (5/5)</em>.
Outstanding. This breaks down the basic tactical themes in a way that just fit
perfectly for me -- whenever I finished a chapter, I would immediately start
to see those ideas popping up in games. I read this online from his website.</p>

<p><a href="http://amazon.com/dp/1931930996/">Encountering the Chinese</a>, <em>by Hu Wenzhong (4/5)</em>.
This was a good cultural overview of China. I was aware of all the broad
themes, but I found a number of subtleties that refined my understanding, and
put some previous interactions in a new light. Very useful. Including pinyin
without tone marks is annoying, though.</p>

<p><a href="http://amazon.com/dp/082642788X/">Let&#39;s Talk About Love</a>, <em>by Carl Wilson (3/5)</em>.
I liked the parts about the socio-economics of &quot;taste&quot;, and signalling of
social and cultural capital. I&#39;ve never been a Céline hater, so I found the
hand-wringing about liking her to be kind of dull.</p>

<p><a href="http://amazon.com/dp/1422186431/">Leading Change</a>, <em>by John P. Kotter (4/5)</em>.
Great advice on what it will take to achieve change in large, slow-moving
organizations. All of the obstacles and anti-patterns were painfully familiar,
and the advice seems straightforward in retrospect, but isn&#39;t obvious when
you&#39;re in the middle of the problem.</p>

<p><a href="http://amazon.com/dp/0674729013/">Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning</a>, <em>by Peter C. Brown (4/5)</em>.
How to learn? You&#39;re probably doing at least some of it wrong (inefficiently).
My two biggest takeaways are: 1) to move on well before you have &quot;mastered&quot;
the material, and instead come back repeatedly to build up your levels, and 2)
that retrieval is what you&#39;re really after, and quizzes are &quot;retrieval
practice&quot;... quiz always.</p>

<p><a href="http://amazon.com/dp/0262201682/">Evocative Objects: Things We Think with</a>, <em>by Sherry Turkle (4/5)</em>.
Great book, with lots of linkages to other people I find interesting (Piaget,
Seymour Papert, Marcel Mauss). Should be nibbled on, don&#39;t overdo it. A couple
of the objects were personally evocative (raincoat hood!), most were
interesting.</p>

<p><a href="http://amazon.com/dp/1941875033/">盲人国 (The Country of the Blind)</a>, <em>by H.G. Wells (4/5)</em>.
My first &quot;book&quot; read in Chinese... exhausting! Quite well done given the very
limited vocabulary, and the repetition definitely helped my reading speed a
lot.</p>

<p><a href="http://amazon.com/dp/0231149913/">Uncreative Writing</a>, <em>by Kenneth Goldsmith (2/5)</em>.
Whatever. Wanted to like this, but it had no substance, and the author got off
on the wrong foot with me by not understanding what a binary file is. Still,
there were a few interesting references like Sol LeWitt&#39;s wall drawings.</p>

<p><a href="http://amazon.com/dp/1941875009/">秘密花园 (The Secret Garden)</a>, <em>by Frances Hodgson Burnett (4/5)</em>.
Chinese Graded Reader edition. Not much new vocab, but the repetition really
helps my reading speed.</p>

<p><a href="http://amazon.com/dp/1941875017/">卷发公司的案子 (Sherlock Holmes and the Red-Headed League)</a>, <em>by Arthur Conan Doyle (4/5)</em>.
Quick and simple translation of the story. Good practice material for reading
speed.</p>

<p><a href="http://amazon.com/dp/0804139024/">The Martian</a>, <em>by Andy Weir (2/5)</em>.
Pure hard sci-fi plus survival fantasy. It was OK, but without any
psychological angle to drive it, I got crisis fatigue from one emergency
stacked on top of another.</p>

<p><a href="http://amazon.com/dp/1941875041/">六十年的梦 (The Sixty Year Dream)</a>, <em>by Washington Irving (4/5)</em>.
Rip Van Winkle in Beijing. This is a graded reader for learning to read 
Chinese.</p>

<p><a href="http://amazon.com/dp/0824827600/">Ideogram: Chinese Characters and the Myth of Disembodied Meaning</a>, <em>by J. Marshall Unger (3/5)</em>.
Really interesting, although I wasn&#39;t able to make much sense of the second
half. Favourite part was the comparison to English shorthand rules and
techniques.</p>

<p><a href="http://amazon.com/dp/0692442901/">TPRS with Chinese Characteristics</a>, <em>by Terry T. Waltz (3/5)</em>.
I&#39;m not a teacher -- I read this looking for ideas to help my self-study. To
that end, I didn&#39;t really find much new, as it was all pretty general and I
had seen most things from other sources already.</p>

<p><a href="http://amazon.com/dp/B003VS0MZQ/">Dave Barry Does Japan</a>, <em>by Dave Barry (3/5)</em>.
Good fun, classic Dave Barry. A bunch of genuine laugh-out-loud moments in there.</p>

<p><a href="http://amazon.com/dp/3037781831/">White</a>, <em>by Kenya Hara (3/5)</em>.
I love his designs, but I had trouble getting anything out of this.</p>

<p><a href="http://amazon.com/dp/0470624159/">The Little Book That Still Beats the Market</a>, <em>by Joel Greenblatt (3/5)</em>.
Very basic idea expanded with a lot of backstory.</p>

<p><a href="http://amazon.com/dp/B0168JS8IC/">Foundations of Chinese Characters</a>, <em>by Kyle Balmer (3/5)</em>.
Introduction to the structure and system of Chinese writing.</p>

<p><a href="http://amazon.com/dp/0982273606/">Earth Vs. Everybody</a>, <em>by John Swartzwelder (3/5)</em>.
Frank Burly is at it again... a zany cartoon, nothing more (and I read it in Mexifo).</p>

<p><a href="http://amazon.com/dp/0143125427/">Lexicon</a>, <em>by Max Barry (4/5)</em>.
Fun read. Matrix meets sorcery, kind of an action movie.</p>

<p><a href="http://amazon.com/dp/0062224662/">The Art of Communicating</a>, <em>by Thich Nhat Hanh (4/5)</em>.
Great reminders. Just be here, now, and listen with compassion.</p>

<p><a href="http://amazon.com/dp/0060555661/">The Intelligent Investor</a>, <em>by Preston Pysh (5/5)</em>.
You are probably a defensive investor, now act like one.</p>

<p><a href="http://amazon.com/dp/1400205573/">Notes from a Blue Bike</a>, <em>by Tsh Oxenreider (2/5)</em>.
Meh. I judged the book by its cover and I expected more than anecdotes.</p>
