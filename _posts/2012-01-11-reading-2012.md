Here we go again...


[Medium Raw](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003JBI2WU/), _by Anthony Bourdain (4/5)_. 
War-stories from the kitchen. A much more mature rant than some of his earlier
writing.

[A Thousand Dreams](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0042X9MGY/), _by Larry Campbell (4/5)_.  
The writing is a bit dry, but the insight on some contemporary Vancouver
history (which I only knew in general terms) was great.

[Flashman](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002RI9J2I/), _by George MacDonald Fraser (5/5 - re-read)_. 
Flashy, you delightful cad! Enjoyed it as much as the first time I read it. 

[The Wallstreet Journal Guide to Information Graphics](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0393072959/), _by Dona M Wong (4/5)_. 
A great basic reference for visual literacy and data presentation.

[Blindness](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003T0GBOM/), _by José Saramago (4/5)_.

[An Artist of the Floating World](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002RI91PS/), _by Kazuo Ishiguro (4/5)_. 
Subtle, but that carried me along.

[Beer is Proof God Loves Us](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00403MNSK/), _by Charles Bamforth (3/5)_.

[Proofs Without Words](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0883857006/), _by Roger B. Nelsen (4/5)_.

[The Cluetrain Manifesto](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002EF2AE8/), _by Christopher Locke et al. (4/5 re-read)_. 
Interesting to re-read this 10 years later. Some of it is totally prescient,
and some seems fairly naive. A little too much romanticizing of craft
traditions, and nostalgia for "the old ways", but it captures the changes of
the Net pretty well.

[The Game](http://www.amazon.com/Game-Ken-Dryden/dp/0470835842/), _by Ken Dryden (4/5)_.

[Old Man's War](http://www.amazon.com/Old-Mans-War-John-Scalzi/dp/0765348276/), _by John Scalzi (2/5)_. 
Standard space-marine fluff. Not really my kind of sci-fi.

[The Time Machine Did It](http://www.amazon.com/Time-Machine-Did-John-Swartzwelder-ebook/dp/B004P1JTM0/), _by John Swartzwelder (3/5)_. 
Absurd stream-of-consciousness by the most prolific Simpsons writer. Some
awesome moments in there.

[How to Wrap Five Eggs](http://www.amazon.com/How-Wrap-Five-Eggs-Traditional/dp/1590306198/), _by Hideyuki Oka (3/5)_. 
A few interesting packages, but would have be nice to have the description of
the contents closer than the appendix.

[Steal Like an Artist](http://www.amazon.com/Steal-Like-Artist-Things-Creative/dp/0761169253/), _by Austin Kleon (3/5)_. 
A nice compact reminder to keep moving. I love the idea of exploring your
creative family tree.

[Damn Good Advice (For People with Talent!)](http://www.amazon.com/Damn-Good-Advice-People-Talent/dp/0714863483/), _by George Lois (3/5)_. 
Rapid-fire advice and autobiography from an iconic ad man -- the original Mad
Man (a show he hates)_. You definitely know his work even if you don't recognize
his name.

[The Code of the Woosters](http://www.amazon.com/Code-Woosters-Jeeves-Wooster-ebook/dp/B0031RS7A4/), _by P.G. Wodehouse (3/5)_. 
Wonderful in places and wonderfully dull overall.

[Man Descending](http://www.amazon.com/Man-Descending-Guy-Vanderhaeghe-ebook/dp/B004GTLVGS/), _by Guy Vanderhaeghe (5/5)_.

[Snow Country](http://www.amazon.com/Snow-Country-Penguin-Modern-Classics-ebook/dp/B00B0LP3U0/), _by Yasunari Kawabata (4/5)_.

[The Social Life of Small Urban Spaces](http://www.amazon.com/Social-Life-Small-Urban-Spaces/dp/097063241X/), _by William H. Whyte (3/5)_. 
Really interesting material, but the format of this book (photos and long
paragraphs) makes it tough to pick out the important points.

[It's Not How Good You Are, It's How Good You Want to Be](http://www.amazon.com/Its-Not-How-Good-Want/dp/0714843377/), _by Paul Arden (3/5)

[The Worst Journey in the World](http://www.amazon.com/Worst-Journey-World-Antarctic-1910-1913-ebook/dp/B004TIKVGM/), _by Apsley Cherry-Garrard (3/5)_. 
I didn't survive the journey. Fascinating subject, but too laborious for me...
I'll have to try again another time.

[The Curve of Time](http://www.amazon.com/Curve-Time-M-Wylie-Blanchet/dp/1770500375/), _by M. Wylie Blanchet (4/5)_.

[A Poetry Handbook](http://www.amazon.com/Poetry-Handbook-Mary-Oliver/dp/0156724006/), _by Mary Oliver (5/5)_. 
A beautifully poetic explanation of the craft of writing.

[Information Graphics: A Comprehensive Illustrated Reference](http://www.amazon.com/Information-Graphics-Comprehensive-Illustrated-Reference/dp/0195135326/), _by Robert L. Harris (4/5)_. 
Lots of examples to pick out the details from. Doesn't directly recommend any
approach over others.

[The Grammar of Graphics](http://www.amazon.com/The-Grammar-Graphics-Statistics-Computing/dp/0387245448/), _by Lealand Wilkinson (5/5)_. 
A systematic algebra for describing charts and graphics.

[Dropping Ashes on the Buddha](http://www.amazon.com/Dropping-Ashes-Buddha-Teachings-Master-ebook/dp/B005FFPMWG/), _by Seung Sahn (3/5)_. 
A collection of koans and teaching stories from a Korean Zen master. I didn't
find this as good as the collection of teaching letters to his students, "Only
Don't Know".

[Just Enough Software Architecture](http://www.amazon.com/Just-Enough-Software-Architecture-Risk-Driven/dp/0984618104/), _by George H. Fairbanks (5/5)_. 
If you could read only one book about software architecture, this should be
it. It's a great examination of the process of architecting, and a reminder
to always be conscious of why you're using a certain approach.
