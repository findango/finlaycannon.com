### Top books this year

[A Poetry Handbook](http://www.amazon.com/Poetry-Handbook-Mary-Oliver/dp/0156724006/), by Mary Oliver (5/5)  
A beautifully poetic explanation of the craft of writing.

[The Grammar of Graphics](http://www.amazon.com/The-Grammar-Graphics-Statistics-Computing/dp/0387245448/), by Lealand Wilkinson (5/5)  
A systematic algebra for describing charts and graphics.

[Just Enough Software Architecture](http://www.amazon.com/Just-Enough-Software-Architecture-Risk-Driven/dp/0984618104/), by George H. Fairbanks (5/5)  
If you could read only one book about software architecture, this should be it. It's a great examination of the process of architecting, and a reminder to always be conscious of why you're using a certain approach.

### All the rest

[Medium Raw](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003JBI2WU/), by Anthony Bourdain (4/5)  
War-stories from the kitchen. A much more mature rant than some of his earlier writing.

[A Thousand Dreams](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0042X9MGY/), by Larry Campbell (4/5)  
The writing is a bit dry, but the insight on some contemporary Vancouver history (which I only knew in general terms) was great.

[Flashman](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002RI9J2I/), by George MacDonald Fraser (5/5 - re-read)  
Flashy, you delightful cad! Enjoyed it as much as the first time I read it.

[The Wallstreet Journal Guide to Information Graphics](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0393072959/), by Dona M Wong (4/5)  
A great basic reference for visual literacy and data presentation.

[Blindness](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003T0GBOM/), by José Saramago (4/5)

[An Artist of the Floating World](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002RI91PS/), by Kazuo Ishiguro (4/5)  
Subtle, but that carried me along.

[Beer is Proof God Loves Us](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00403MNSK/), by Charles Bamforth (3/5).

[Proofs Without Words](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0883857006/), by Roger B. Nelsen (4/5).

[The Cluetrain Manifesto](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002EF2AE8/), by Christopher Locke et al. (4/5 re-read)  
Interesting to re-read this 10 years later. Some of it is totally prescient, and some seems fairly naive. A little too much romanticizing of craft traditions, and nostalgia for "the old ways", but it captures the changes of the Net pretty well.

[The Game](http://www.amazon.com/Game-Ken-Dryden/dp/0470835842/), by Ken Dryden (4/5).

[Old Man's War](http://www.amazon.com/Old-Mans-War-John-Scalzi/dp/0765348276/), by John Scalzi (2/5)  
Standard space-marine fluff. Not really my kind of sci-fi.

[The Time Machine Did It](http://www.amazon.com/Time-Machine-Did-John-Swartzwelder-ebook/dp/B004P1JTM0/), by John Swartzwelder (3/5)  
Absurd stream-of-consciousness by the most prolific Simpsons writer. Some awesome moments in there.

[How to Wrap Five Eggs](http://www.amazon.com/How-Wrap-Five-Eggs-Traditional/dp/1590306198/), by Hideyuki Oka (3/5)  
A few interesting packages, but would have be nice to have the description of the contents closer than the appendix.

[Steal Like an Artist](http://www.amazon.com/Steal-Like-Artist-Things-Creative/dp/0761169253/), by Austin Kleon (3/5)  
A nice compact reminder to keep moving. I love the idea of exploring your creative family tree.

[Damn Good Advice (For People with Talent!)](http://www.amazon.com/Damn-Good-Advice-People-Talent/dp/0714863483/), by George Lois (3/5). Rapid-fire advice and autobiography from an iconic ad man -- the original Mad Man (a show he hates). You definitely know his work even if you don't recognize his name.

[The Code of the Woosters](http://www.amazon.com/Code-Woosters-Jeeves-Wooster-ebook/dp/B0031RS7A4/), by P.G. Wodehouse (3/5)  
Wonderful in places and wonderfully dull overall.

[Man Descending](http://www.amazon.com/Man-Descending-Guy-Vanderhaeghe-ebook/dp/B004GTLVGS/), by Guy Vanderhaeghe (5/5).

[Snow Country](http://www.amazon.com/Snow-Country-Penguin-Modern-Classics-ebook/dp/B00B0LP3U0/), by Yasunari Kawabata (4/5).

[The Social Life of Small Urban Spaces](http://www.amazon.com/Social-Life-Small-Urban-Spaces/dp/097063241X/), by William H. Whyte (3/5)  
Really interesting material, but the format of this book (photos and long paragraphs) makes it tough to pick out the important points.

[It's Not How Good You Are, It's How Good You Want to Be](http://www.amazon.com/Its-Not-How-Good-Want/dp/0714843377/), by Paul Arden (3/5)

[The Worst Journey in the World](http://www.amazon.com/Worst-Journey-World-Antarctic-1910-1913-ebook/dp/B004TIKVGM/), by Apsley Cherry-Garrard (3/5)  
I didn't survive the journey. Fascinating subject, but too laborious for me... I'll have to try again another time.

[The Curve of Time](http://www.amazon.com/Curve-Time-M-Wylie-Blanchet/dp/1770500375/), by M. Wylie Blanchet (4/5).

[Information Graphics: A Comprehensive Illustrated Reference](http://www.amazon.com/Information-Graphics-Comprehensive-Illustrated-Reference/dp/0195135326/), by Robert L. Harris (4/5)  
Lots of examples to pick out the details from. Doesn't directly recommend any approach over others.

[Dropping Ashes on the Buddha](http://www.amazon.com/Dropping-Ashes-Buddha-Teachings-Master-ebook/dp/B005FFPMWG/), by Seung Sahn (3/5)  
A collection of koans and teaching stories from a Korean Zen master. I didn't find this as good as the collection of teaching letters to his students, "Only Don't Know".
