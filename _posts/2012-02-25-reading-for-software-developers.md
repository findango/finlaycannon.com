title: A reading list for Software Developers
excerpt: Allow me to suggest some aspects of development that you might
         consider to become better (and better-rounded).
---

There are lots of books out there about the current dominant programming
languages (or the currently hip and fashionable smaller languages). You can
find these by searching Amazon or Stackoverflow. But software development is,
for me, much more about thinking skills, design tradeoffs, and communication. 
Let me suggest some other aspects of the job that you might consider to become 
a better developer.


#### Develop a framework for problem solving


* [How To Solve It: A New Aspect of Mathematical Method](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/4871878309/), by George Polya <br>
  This is a great set of patterns for approaching problems in a structured way.
  Although intended for mathematical problems, I find that asking the same
  questions can really focus my thinking on anything.  What are the knowns?
  What are the unknowns? Can you find an analogous problem and solve that?
  ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Solve_It))

* [Six Thinking Hats](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0316178314/), by Edward de Bono <br>
  People working in a group typically play several roles (eg, devil's advocate,
  positive thinker, moderator), but they usually do it unconsciously. If we are aware
  of what kind of thinking is needed at a certain moment, we can
  work together in the same mode, instead of battling each other just because
  we have different assumptions about what we're trying to accomplish.


#### Learn how to communicate visually

* [The Wall Street Journal Guide to Information Graphics](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0393072959/), by Dona M. Wong <br>
  If you need to share quantitative data from tests, benchmarks, etc., it's a
  good idea to understand the basics of visually presenting your data. It also
  helps to recognize presentations from others that are confusing or
  misleading.

* [The Elements of UML 2.0 Style](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0521616786/), by Scott W. Ambler <br>
  A quick and pragmatic guide to UML diagram types.  Which kind of diamond to
  use on this line? When in doubt, leave it out.

* [101 Things I Learned in Architecture School](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0262062666/), by Matthew Frederick <br>
  You should learn how to use figure and ground in your drawings. And how 
  to draw a perfect rectangle.

#### Manage your time effectively

* [Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0142000280/), by David Allen <br>
  Get your TODOs out of your head and into a system where you can be certain
  they will not be forgotten. Divide your time consciously between planning and
  doing. Also be careful to define tasks that really are "do-able" (it's common
  to write todos that are subtly vague in a way that makes them tough to
  complete).

* [Pomodoro Technique Illustrated](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1934356506/), by Staffan Noteberg <br>
  This is kind of like iterative development for your tasks. Work in small
  batches at a sustainable pace, focus on one thing, and reflect in order to
  improve.


#### Think a bit about the problems that your manager faces. Empathize, or maybe try to help.

* [Managing Humans: Biting and Humorous Tales of a Software Engineering Manager](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/159059844X/), by Michael Lopp <br>
  Most individual developers have no idea what their
  manager really does, and there's a cultural blind-spot of considering
  anything other than coding as "not real work". In my experience, people who
  "get their boss's job" are usually surprised at how much was going on that
  they were being shielded from. For a dev manager, this book hits the nail
  right on the head, with humour. Learn a bit about the business outside of
  code, and you'll be a huge benefit to your boss.



#### Learn a vocabulary of patterns, at different levels of abstraction

* [Emergent Design: The Evolutionary Nature of Professional Software Development](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0321509366/), by Scott Bain <br>
  An excellent book, explaining the ways that
  pressures on your software (over time) can guide your design to grow along
  with the needs. Use of patterns emerge from the need, rather than being a
  design goal from the start.

* [Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0321127420/), by Martin Fowler <br>
  Higher-level patterns at the application level.
  This is an area where there seems to be a bit of a gap in software
  literature, and this, along with the others in the Martin Fowler series (eg,
  Enterprise Integration Patterns), is a much-needed catalog for application
  developers.

* [Refactoring to Patterns](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0321213351/), by Joshua Kerievsky <br>
  Framing patterns as solutions to a "code smell" is
  much more effective than learning them abstractly and then looking for places
  to apply your new knowledge.

* [Smalltalk Best Practice Patterns](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/013476904X/), by Kent Beck <br>
  This is the best resource I've found for patterns
  at the class and method level (eg, ExplainingMethod, DefaultValue). This was
  also published with Java code under the title "Implementation Patterns", but
  somehow the Smalltalk version is much better.


#### Consider the history and future of your profession

* [The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/020161622X/), by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas <br>
  Not only very practical advice, but at the same
  time the philosophy and wisdom of years of experience behind that advice.
  Study this and study your craft.

* [Software Craftsmanship: The New Imperative](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201733862/), by Pete McBreen <br>
  Software really isn't a science, so is there
  anything we can learn from the craft traditions? Studying the work of
  masters, working with more experienced developers as mentors, mixing
  theoretical learning with practical application.

* [The Mythical Man-Month](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201835959/), by Frederick P. Brooks <br>
  A classic, and still applicable nearly 40 years
  later because it's still people developing software.
