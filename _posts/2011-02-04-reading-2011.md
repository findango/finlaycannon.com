Well... same number of books as [2010](/reading-2010/). That was an accident.


[What We Say Goes](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0805086714), _by Noam Chomsky (5/5)_

[Eating the Dinosaur](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005Q5ONEI), _by Chuck Klosterman (5/5)_. 
An odd but enjoyable collection of chapters on contemporary culture topics (eg, how American football is socialist at heart).

[Looking Around](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0140168893), _by Witold Rybczynski (4/5)_. 
Short essays on a wide range of topics in architecture for the layman.

[Making Software](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0596808321), _by Andy Oram & Greg Wilson (4/5)_

[Stranger in a Strange Land](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0441788386), _by Robert A. Heinlen (3/5)_. 
I grokked it better than when I read it as a teenager, but it didn't do much for me.

[Still Life with Woodpecker](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0553348973), _by Tom Robbins (4/5)_

[Machine of Death](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0982167121), _by Ryan North, Matthew Bennardo, and David Malki (4/5)_. 
Thirty-four short stories based on the premise of a machine that can accurately predict the means of your death (but often in a maddeningly ambiguous and sometimes ironic way). Lots of inescapable fates after the style of Oedipus.

[Chuck Klosterman IV](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0743284895), _by Chuck Klosterman (4/5)_. 
Another great collection of essays on pop culture previously published in SPIN, Esquire, etc. More music industry than Eating the Dinosaur.

[My Life in France](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B006G89IOO), _by Julia Child (5/5)_

[True Love](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0061096164), _by Robert Fulghum (3/5)_

[Startup Nation](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0446541478), _by Dan Senor and Saul Singer (3/5)_

[Walk on Water](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0142004111), _by Michael Ruhlman (5/5)_. 
It's absolutely incredible what is now considered routine in pediatric heart surgery, but I wonder if the total cost is really worth it? The differences in mortality between the best and worst hospitals is shocking.

[Altered Carbon](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0345457692), _by Richard Morgan (4/5)_. 
The Matrix meets Blade Runner? But with exchangeable physical bodies (sleeves).

[The Creature from Beyond Infinity](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1419158031), _by Henry Kuttner (3/5)_. 
Fun but very simple. Like reading a comic.

[The Introvert Advantage](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0761123695), _by Marti Olsen Laney (4/5)_. 
Lots of interesting nuggets in there for self-reflection, but very repetitive and too self-help for my liking.

[Six Days of War: June 1967 and the Making of the Modern Middle East](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0345461924), _by Michael B. Oren (4/5)_

[Wooden Boats](http://www.amazon.com/dp/014200121X), _by Michael Ruhlman (4/5)_

[A Wild Sheep Chase](http://www.amazon.com/dp/037571894X), _by Haruki Murakami (4/5)_

[Teach Us to Outgrow Our Madness](http://www.amazon.com/dp/080215185X), _by Kenzaburo Oe (3/5)_. 
I really liked "A Personal Matter", but this collection of shorter stories seemed like a rehash of similar ideas. Or maybe they came first and I read these in reverse order.

[Never Let Me Go](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1400078776), _by Kazuo Ishiguro (5/5)_

[The Unfolding of Language](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0805080120), _by Guy Deutscher (5/5)_. 
The drivers for the incredible complexity of language boil down to: desire for more expressiveness, economy of energy, and analogy. Oh, and if you don't like modern changes, remember that every generation has lamented the death of the language, and held the previous 100 years as the pinnacle. Ok, c u l8r.

[Roasting in Hell's Kitchen](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0061191981), _by Gordon Ramsay (5/5)_

[Seven-Tenths: The Sea and its Thresholds](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1933372699), _by James Hamilton-Paterson (4/5)_

[Sh\*t my Dad Says](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0061992704), _by Justin Halpern (4/5)_

[Bounce](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004NSVE5U), _by Matthew Syed (3/5)_

[Letters from the Hive](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0553382667), _by Stephen Buchmann and Banning Repplier (3/5)_

[Regeneration](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0452270073), _by Pat Barker (4/5)_

[Thick Face Black Heart](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0446670200), _by Ching-Ning Chu (3/5)_. 
Somewhat in the style of all the 'Art of War' business books. It started out with a couple of great chapters, but quickly devolved into an odd Christian interpretation of the Dharma.

[Calling Out For You](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0099565498), _by Karin Fossum (5/5)_. 
A murder-mystery with writing as sparse as the Norwegian landscape it describes. Beautiful character development.

[The Wind-up Bird Chronicle](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0679775439), _by Haruki Murakami (4/5)_. 
More complex plot than A Wild Sheep Chase. Some similar themes.

[Stories of Your Life and Others](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1931520720), _by Ted Chiang (4/5)_. 
Spiritual science fiction.

[Rashomon and Seventeen Other Stories](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0140449701), _by Ryūnosuke Akutagawa (2/5)_. 
A couple of gems, but the rest did nothing for me at all. I guess he gets high ratings because of his historical place in Japanese writing.

[Just a Geek](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0596806310), _by Wil Wheaton (3/5)_

[The Sky Is Not The Limit](http://www.amazon.com/dp/159102188X), _by Neil deGrasse Tyson (2/5)_. 
I wanted to like this, but... meh. (Some nerd-rage on misrepresenting physics in pop-culture, etc., I couldn't tell if he was serious).

[Volt: Stories](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1555975771), _by Alan Heathcock (4/5)_. 
Harsh.
